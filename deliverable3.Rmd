# Revision

To start this deliverable off, I am going to dive in to the changes that I have made on the previous deliverable. One major change that has occured is that I have cut the data down in almost half. I am now only pouring over the years 1990-2011, instead of from 1950. This is due to the fact that there was a lot of missing data in the earlier years and that I am using 3-point statistics and the 3-point line wasn't introduced until 1979. I know that I am using for loops to loop through the vectors but when I switched it over to using the 'sapply' function, it ran at the axact same speed and not any quicker. Also, I couldn't get it to get the right data and create the correct tibbles with 'sapply'. I have also explained the variables better while changing some of their names for better understanding. I have also made sure to remove NA values from the tables so to make them tidy.
