### 2. Model Planning and Building

This deliverable brings in another dataset that will help make predictions on individual game scores and provide us with the ability to use yearly stats to predict daily events.  

[Second deliverable](deliverable2.html)

### 3. Results and Operationalization

The third and final deliverable will dive into any additional models and insights that may have come up during the process of creating the first two deliverables.
